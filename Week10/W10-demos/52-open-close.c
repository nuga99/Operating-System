 * === umask() ===
 * int open(const char* pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
 * === FLAGS: ===
 * O_RDONLY	Open the file so that it is read only.
 * O_WRONLY	Open the file so that it is write only.
 * O_RDWR	Open the file so that it can be read from and written to.

 * O_TRUNC	Initially clear all data from the file.
 * O_CREAT	If the file does not exist, create it. 
                You must include the third parameter.
 * O_EXCL	With O_CREAT: exists, the call will fail.

 *
 * file 2 : if file2 doesnt exist, then it will be created
 * the file will be open out for reading and writing
 * file2 created with read/write/execute for the file owner (S_IRWXU),
 * read/write permission for the file's group (S_IRGRP and S_IWGRP),
 * read permission for users other than the file owner
