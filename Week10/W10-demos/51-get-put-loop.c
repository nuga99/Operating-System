/*
 * TAKE NOTE(AII)

 * getchar() reads a single character from the standard 
 * input stream and writes it to cc
 * putchar(char) writes a character (an unsigned char) 
 * specified by the argument char to stdout
 *
 * this program will continue to read character from stdin 
 * until EOF, that is, no more input from a stream
 * EOF is defined in stdio.h (and is usually -1). 
 * On linux, ctrl+d signals EOF, and on windows it's ctrl+z.
